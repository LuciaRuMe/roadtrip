At the moment all explanation in code is in Spanish but I'll eventually upload an English version.

It is a Genetic Algorithm trying to solve a Travelling Salesman Problem. 

My idea is to optimize a roadtrip around Europe where users can choose their stops (they have to be chosen from a closed list I created doing web scraping).

There are 2 rules: 1. The trip has to finish in the same place it begins. 2. Cities can be visited only once.
